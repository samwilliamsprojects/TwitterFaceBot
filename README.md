# TwitterFaceBot

Twitter bot designed to recognize a face that it is trained on and respond accordingly.

Tensorflow==2.9.0 is required; a newer version does not work with EfficentNet3B.

My bot was able to achieve 95% testing accuracy with only 200 images. I used a lot of data augmentation through addition of Gaussian noise, brightness differences, transitions, etc, but was still very impressed with the results of only 200 images. 

The bot can be found at https://twitter.com/IsThisRyanNovak

Reach out to me with any questions: samwilliams98@gmail.com, I would love to help you do this if interested. Was a good joke and I learned a lot through the process.
